==== About ====
Badger is a tool I wrote to remind me when I leave my smartcard in my laptop.
It provides a configurable set of notifications that are triggered when
a computer is locked with a smartcard still inserted.

=== Requirements ===
badger is mainly targeted towards Windows. There is now support for lock screen
detection in Linux and Mac OS X, but it is largely untested or has known issues.

All required modules should be available via easy_install

==== Common Requirements ====
Python. Written with 2.7, but others should work.
appdirs (https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs). Just the one .py is enough if you don't want to install it
pyscard for smart card support (http://pyscard.sourceforge.net/) Tested with 1.6.10

==== Windows specific Requirements =====
ctypes (included as of Python 2.5)
py2exe (only needed to create distributable exe's)
NSIS (only needed to create installers)

==== Mac OS X specific Requirements =====
pcsc-lite 
psutil (https://code.google.com/p/psutil/)
py2app (only to generate standalone app)

==== Linux specific requirements ====
pcsc-lite
Lock screen detection only supports XScreenSaver

=== Features ===
badger currently supports 3 notification modes:
- SoundHandler: Play a wav file (configurable)
- PopupHandler: Display a popup message over the lock screen (Currently Windows only)
- EmailHandler: Send an email (handy for sending an SMS to a phone)

=== Configuration ===
Configuration is performed using the config.json file in the badger directory
TODO: Add more information about configuration

=== Usage ===
Run badger.pyw.  If you have built an exe (see below), run badger.exe.
It will show up in the system tray. Add a shortcut to your startup folder!

NOTE: Badger dies silently with configuration errors right now. Make sure the tray icon
is there.

=== Making an EXE (Windows) ===
A build file is included to create a distributable exe file. Run:
python setup.py py2exe
in the top level dir. It will create a "build" folder that can be zipped and distributed.

The exe may have a dependency on MSVCP90.dll, which is not included in the build folder.
See http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=29 for details.
In my experience, a lot of people already have this DLL.

=== Making an installer (Windows) ===
Build the exe, then build the NSIS installer with the included script. Define VER to set the version
number of the installer exe

=== Known Issues ===
See issue tracker at https://github.com/jeffmelville/badger for up to date info
- There is a race case with the PopupHandler if the popup is generated too close to the screen
  being locked. The configurable "delay" parameter exists as a workaround for now. The 
  value in the default config.json has worked well on my machine
- The Linux version hangs on exit
